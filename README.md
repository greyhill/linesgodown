# `linesgodown.py`

This is library for making slightly nicer looking plots of lines going down.

The utility of this library will be immediately obvious to those working in 
optimization.

This library has experimental support for lines that go up, or behave in a 
nonmonotonic fashion.  The usage is the same.
